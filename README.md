# AutomaticSolar-poweredGrassCutter
AUTOMATIC SOLAR-POWERED GRASS CUTTER WITH GRASS LEVEL SELECTOR

Overview
This project is a solar-powered, automatic grass cutter that allows the user to select the desired grass cutting height. It uses renewable energy to reduce environmental pollution and provides a customizable cutting mechanism for different grass levels.

Features
Solar-Powered Operation: Uses a 20W solar panel and rechargeable battery.

Grass Height Selection: User sets the cutting height using a keypad (0â€“7 cm).

Obstacle Detection: Equipped with ultrasonic and infrared sensors to avoid obstacles.

Automation: Moves and cuts grass automatically without manual control.

LCD Display: Shows grass height input and system status.

Energy Efficient: Runs on clean, renewable solar energy.

Hardware Components
Solar Panel (20W)

Rechargeable Battery (12V, 10Ah)

DC Motors (for wheels and cutter)

Stepper Motor (for blade height adjustment)

Arduino Uno

L298N Motor Driver

Ultrasonic Sensor

Infrared Sensor

LCD Display (I2C)

Keypad

How It Works
User Input: The user selects the desired grass cutting height using the keypad.

Blade Adjustment: The stepper motor adjusts the blade height accordingly.

Cutting and Navigation: The system starts cutting grass and moves forward. Sensors detect obstacles and help avoid collisions.

Display: The LCD shows system messages and selected height.

Limitations
Performance may vary in cloudy weather due to solar dependency.

Sensors may have reduced accuracy on wet or uneven surfaces.

Battery degradation over time may require maintenance.

Future Recommendations
Add a fault detection system for easier maintenance.

Include a grass treatment feature (fertilizer or insecticide sprayer).

Integrate remote monitoring via Wi-Fi or GSM.
